Manuel, standing in the hallway, felt there was someone in the room. He felt it through the door. 'Retana,' he said softly. There was no answer. He tried the knob and it turned and he opened the door and went in. Retana was sitting at his desk looking at some papers. He looked up when Manuel came in. 'Hello,' he said. 'Hello,' said Manuel. 'I came to see you.' 'Sit down,' said Retana. 'Don't get up,' said Manuel. He sat down in the chair by the desk. Retana looked at him. He had a thin face and his eyes were very bright. His hair was gray and he wore a gray suit. He looked at Manuel and Manuel looked at him. 'I came to see you,' Manuel said again. 'Yes,' said Retana. 'I see you.' 'I want to work,' said Manuel. 'Yes,' said Retana. 'I see you want to work.' 'I need to work,' said Manuel. 'Yes,' said Retana. 'I see you need to work.' 'I want to work tonight,' said Manuel. 'Yes,' said Retana. 'I see you want to work tonight.' 'I need to work tonight,' said Manuel. 'Yes,' said Retana. 'I see you need to work tonight.' 'I want to work tonight,' said Manuel. 'Yes,' said Retana. 'I see you want to work tonight.' 'I need to work tonight,' said Manuel. 'Yes,' said Retana. 'I see you need to work tonight.'"
